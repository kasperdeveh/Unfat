# Changelog

## 2026-04-26
- Initial CLAUDE.md with project context, tech stack and conventions
- ROADMAP.md filled with sub-project decomposition (A-G)
- Devcontainer setup notes documented in `docs/prep.md`
- CLAUDE.md: added "memory transparency" rule (always state where info is stored)
- CLAUDE.md: added devcontainer rebuild warning rule
- ROADMAP.md: extended G with future features captured during brainstorm (light mode, private products, duplicate merge, quick-add sheet, friend compare widget, password login)
- Design spec for sub-projects A+B (Foundation + Solo tracking MVP) at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-foundation-mvp-design.md`
- Implementation plan for A+B at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-foundation-mvp.md`
- Added `.superpowers/` to `.gitignore` for brainstorm visual companion artifacts
- Implemented sub-project A (Foundation): Supabase backend with Auth + RLS policies, mini hash-router SPA, dark sporty PWA (manifest + service worker), GitHub Pages deploy via Action
- Implemented sub-project B (Solo tracking MVP): dashboard with 3-state hero card (under target / over target / over max), shared products database, voeg-eten-toe flow (search + portion picker + new product), settings view with goal editing
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in dashboard view: shared product names are now HTML-escaped before rendering
- Removed `docs/HANDOFF.md` (was a temporary session bridge note)
- Auth pivot: replaced magic link with email + password (signUp + signInWithPassword). Reason: Supabase free tier rate-limits all auth emails to 2 per hour project-wide, making magic link unusable for even a single tester. Set "Confirm email" off in Supabase project to allow instant login after signup. Magic link can return later once custom SMTP via Resend is set up — see ROADMAP G.
- Service worker now skipped on localhost (avoided dev cache headaches); cache version bumped to v2 for production users
- Fixed magic-link redirect race condition (now obsolete after auth pivot but the bootstrap fix still applies — the app waits for INITIAL_SESSION before routing)
